# Dental Research AI

AI in Research (Dental): free practical education for dental researchers using AI responsibly and ethically.

**Website address:** <https://wslinmsai.github.io/dental-research-ai/>

The website is published with GitHub Pages from `main` at the repository root. The complete site also opens locally: download `index.html` and open it in a modern browser. The embedded Excel downloads work offline too.

## What is included

- 12 lessons covering responsible AI, proposals, evidence searching, synthesis, data management, statistics, manuscript writing, editorial checks, figures, submission, peer review, and conference presentations.
- 24 copyable prompt templates, each followed by an article-specific complete prompt, an sample response, a JOP publication link, source locations, and a verification step.
- A Published examples page covering five study designs: umbrella review, clinical case report, factorial laboratory study, computational proof of concept, and paired clinical AI evaluation.
- Research toolkit → AI resources: five practical tool guides with reusable templates, fully filled prompts, sample responses, and a citation-to-manuscript workflow using PubMed and Zotero.
- Larger text in relative units: 18px-equivalent lesson text, 16px-equivalent prompts and form inputs, and supporting text generally 14px or larger at the default browser setting. Responsive layouts accommodate the larger type.
- A local prompt builder, reporting-guideline selector, six-question AI disclosure builder with multiple-tool support, and an 18-item submission checklist.
- Six downloadable Excel workbooks. Each includes a Guide, Blank template, and Completed example; the conference workbook includes editable timing formulas.
- Searchable lessons/examples, source filters, printable lessons, and browser-local progress.
- The original 17 guidance/tool sources were checked 8 September 2026. Publication examples, JOP article categories, and the new AI resource information were checked 9 September 2026. Recheck changing access, plans, and journal rules before use.

The disclosure builder covers tool names/versions, dates, applications, specific sections, accuracy validation, and privacy/compliance safeguards. It links to the [Journal of Prosthodontics author instructions](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/1532849x/homepage/forauthors.html), which direct manuscript AI use to Methods. Authors must verify their actual record and the journal's current requirements.

No installation, account, API key, paid model, or external page assets are required. The core site works offline; external source links require internet access.

## Hosting

In repository **Settings → Pages**, select **Deploy from a branch**, choose **main** and **/(root)**, and save. The root `index.html` is the complete website. `.nojekyll` tells Pages to serve the static files directly. No paid backend or custom domain is needed.

See [GitHub's Pages setup instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site). GitHub Pages supports public repositories on GitHub Free; hosting terms can change.

## Editing

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `src/content.js` | Lessons, prompt templates, guidelines, sources, and worksheet titles |
| `src/examples.js` | 24 complete prompts, sample responses, and brief checks |
| `src/resources.js` | Current AI tool information and five practical worked workflows |
| `src/resource-ui.js` | Publication catalogue, AI resource filters, and copy controls |
| `src/styles.css` | Responsive layout, appearance, and print styles |
| `src/app.js` | Navigation and local tools |
| `src/shell.html` | Page shell, metadata, and navigation |
| `src/workshop-overrides.js` | Workshop home page and creator information |
| `.github/workflows/rebuild-site.yml` | Rebuilds the HTML when source or downloads change |
| `build.py` | Combines the source into the published `index.html` |
| `downloads/*.xlsx` | The six editable Excel workbooks |
| `downloads/workbooks.json` | Workbook filenames, IDs, and example descriptions |

After editing the source, run:

```sh
python3 build.py
```

Commit both the changed source/downloads and the rebuilt root `index.html`. The build embeds the Excel files into the HTML so a standalone backup can download them without a network connection. Pages publishes the file in the repository. The included GitHub Actions workflow also rebuilds it when source files or downloads change; committing the rebuilt file keeps source and deployment together. Python 3 standard library is sufficient. Hash-based navigation needs no server route configuration.

To edit a workbook, open its `.xlsx` file in Excel or a compatible application, preserve the blank/example separation and formulas, save it back to `downloads/`, and rebuild. Adding a new workbook also requires matching IDs in the catalog and worksheet list.

## Privacy and academic scope

The site makes no AI requests, uploads no files, and has no analytics or advertising. Prompt and disclosure entries are not persisted. Only lesson completion and checklist selections are stored in the browser. Browser settings may limit persistence. Hosting providers and linked external services have their own privacy practices.

The teaching content and sample responses were prepared with AI assistance and source checks. They have not undergone independent academic peer review and do not award continuing education credit. Published facts in the worked examples were checked against five author-supplied JOP PDFs. Plans, editing drafts, sample reviewer replies, AI-use logs, and talk timings show possible ways to organize the work. They are not the authors' actual AI-use records or peer-review correspondence. Responses are course demonstrations, not recorded runs of named external tools, completed database searches, or executed analyses. The linked organizations are not represented as sponsors or endorsers.

## Publications used in the examples

| Publication | Study design | JOP link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Alfaraj et al., Harnessing AI in prosthodontics and implant dentistry | Umbrella review | [10.1111/jopr.70091](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jopr.70091) |
| Azpiazu-Flores et al., 3D-printed indexing devices and contemporary scanning | Clinical case report | [10.1111/jopr.70167](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jopr.70167) |
| Ishiguro et al., Scanner type and design–luting combinations | Factorial in vitro study | [10.1111/jopr.70218](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jopr.70218) |
| Omar et al., Virtual articulation using sequential mandibular scans | Single-case proof of concept | [10.1111/jopr.70188](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jopr.70188) |
| Xu et al., ResNet versus technicians for gingival shade matching | Paired clinical AI evaluation | [10.1111/jopr.70151](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jopr.70151) |

The site contains original factual summaries and teaching text, not redistributed article PDFs or figures. Source locations refer to the supplied PDF versions; Early View pagination may change. Full citations and article-specific facts are centralized in `src/examples.js`.

The tool guide includes Gemini Notebook (formerly NotebookLM), ChatGPT, ChatGPT for Clinicians, OpenEvidence, and Elicit. It distinguishes free learning content from external service eligibility and limits. Official sources are linked beside each tool; the ChatGPT for Clinicians entry explicitly notes that its current listed eligible professions do not include dentists.

For institutional use, designate a content maintainer, arrange academic review, and add applicable institutional guidance. Recheck dated journal and conference policies. The tools support author review; they do not certify research quality, regulatory compliance, or readiness for submission.

## Validation

JavaScript syntax, all 24 article-specific examples, publication links and locations, the five resource guides, 72 module copy actions, 15 resource copy actions, bold customization fields, four resource filters, two-tool disclosure output, stale-draft invalidation, and absence of external page assets were checked. The six embedded workbook payloads match the downloadable `.xlsx` bytes. The 12 changed Guide/example sheets were rendered and visually checked; unchanged blank sheets retain their inputs and formulas. Workbook packages contain no cell errors, and table/validation/freeze-pane feature counts were preserved. The conference example totals 8 minutes with 0 remaining; increasing a slide by one minute updates the total to 9 and the status to Over time, then restoring the input restores the original result.

Full browser interaction and website visual tests could not be run in the creation workspace because a browser was unavailable and its download was blocked. Static markup and function checks do not replace native browser layout, form-validity, or download testing. Desktop and phone checks remain recommended before an institutional launch.

## Backup and restoration

The downloadable backup ZIP contains the complete website, editable source, all six Excel workbooks, the workbook catalog, this README, and the original MIT license. Extract it, open `index.html` locally, or upload its contents to the root of a GitHub Pages repository. Preserve `src/` and `downloads/` to make future edits and rebuilds.

## License

This repository uses the MIT license selected by the repository owner; see [LICENSE](LICENSE). Linked third-party guidance and materials retain their respective rights.

## September 14, 2026: simpler prompts for clinicians

All 24 module prompts and five tool walkthroughs now show a short template, a complete prompt using published study details, and a new sample response. Customizable details appear in bold; copy buttons copy clean text. Outputs include proposal aims, manuscript paragraphs, tables, plotting code, reviewer replies, and slides. Source links and brief checks remain beside each example. Sample responses are not the authors’ original AI conversations or transcripts from external services. Existing workshop branding, six Excel workbooks, accessibility improvements, and the JOP disclosure builder are retained.
